everClerk

==============================

A simple Ruby application, using Sinatra, to automate daily Evernote tasks through Evernote Cloud API.

Evernote is an excellent app. EverClerk is intended to augment EverNote features with user-specific demands. A new feature that will be added is the maintenence a "Day Planner" notebook which contains a to-do notes for each day. EverClerk can be used to automate these note creations rather than having to manually create, and remove notes for past days.

For instance, if I wanted a 7 new Day Planner notes created for the coming week, I can automate it with a click that will leave me the following 7 new notes in the Day Planner notebook:

159 Sunday, 08 Jun

160 Monday, 09 Jun

161 Tuesday, 10 Jun

162 Wednesday, 11 Jun

163 Thursday, 12 Jun

164 Friday, 13 Jun

165 Saturday, 14 Jun

The format of the note titles: &lt;Day of year&gt; &lt;Day of week&gt;, &lt;Day of month&gt; &lt;month&gt;
