everClerk
==============================

A simple Ruby application, using Sinatra, to automate daily Evernote tasks through Evernote Cloud API.

Evernote is an excellent app. EverClerk is intended to augment EverNote features with user-specific demands. A new feature that will be added is the maintenence a "Day Planner" notebook which contains a to-do notes for each day. EverClerk can be used to automate these note creations rather than having to manually create, and remove notes for past days.

For instance, if I wanted a 7 new Day Planner notes created for the coming week, I can automate it with a click that will leave me the following 7 new notes in the Day Planner notebook:

159 Sunday, 08 Jun
160 Monday, 09 Jun
161 Tuesday, 10 Jun
162 Wednesday, 11 Jun
163 Thursday, 12 Jun
164 Friday, 13 Jun
165 Saturday, 14 Jun

The format of the note titles: <Day of year> <Day of week>, <Day of month> <month>
