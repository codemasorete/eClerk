everClerk
==============================

A simple Ruby application, using Sinatra, to automate daily Evernote tasks through Evernote Cloud API.

Evernote is an excellent app. EverClerk is intended to augment EverNote features with user-specific demands. A new feature that will be added is the maintenence a "Day Planner" notebook which contains a to-do notes for each day. EverClerk can be used to automate these note creations rather than having to manually create, and remove notes for past days.
